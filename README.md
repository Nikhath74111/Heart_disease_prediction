**Disease Prediction Toolkit**

A simple machine learning toolkit to predict heart disease using patient data.
It covers data cleaning, model training, evaluation, and visualization — all in one place.

🌟 Features

Clean and preprocess the dataset

Train different ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Network)

Evaluate with metrics (accuracy, precision, recall)

Create visualizations to understand data and results

Organized scripts and test cases for easy reuse
